# Mixed_messages
This is the first Codecademy JavaScript project that I remote to Github. Also, this is the first README file with markdown I've created.
I've used **basic** Javascript, more on the code is [here](#How-did-I-create-this-project)

## How to install:

* Download the script.
* Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* With your terminal/commend prompt. choose the dir of the script and run it with Node.js
* Enjoy some dad jokes :)


## How did I create this project:

1. I created a new var and gave it a random number from 0 to 4 with the *Math* lib.
```javascript
let RandomNum = Math.floor(Math.random()*5);
```
2. Next, I used the Switch commend to check for the cases of 0 to 4.
```javascript
switch(RandomNum){
.
.
.
}
```
3. Each case I logged a pre-determined joke:
```javascript
console.log('RANDOM JOKE HERE');
break;
```
## Whats next?:

- I don't know, I might add some more jokes or something. 
- Maybe in a couple of weeks I will be more skilled and will be able to take the jokes stright from some jokes site with html programming.
